HEXcart is a cartridge for Commodore 64. It can fit 16pcs of 8 or 16kB ROM images and supports regular and ultimax ROMs. ROM is selected with a hex-switch. The cartridge was designed mainly for diagnostics use with different tools like Dead Test and Diagnostics. Selection is done with a hex-switch so it can be used with a faulty C64 without any selection menus.

HEXcart contains two flash ROM ICs. One is used for software and the other one is for logic. The logic ROM IC sets the EXROM and GAME signals to the correct state for regular of ultimax ROMs. No need for jumpers or switches.

Both the software ROM and logic ROM are SST39SF020/040 flash ROM ICs. So anyone who can program the flash ROM can also configure the logic ROM. The configuration of the logic ROM is simple.

There are ready made images for SW & logic ROMs.
